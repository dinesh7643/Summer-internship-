Common gaseous pollutants include carbon monoxide, <br><br>sulfur dioxide, chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and nitrogen oxides produced by industry and motor vehicles. Photochemical ozone and <br>smog are created as nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons react to sunlight. Particulate matter, or fine dust is characterized by their micrometrebr
        <br> <br>size PM10 to PM2.5.<br> has widespread consequences on human and environmental health, having systematic impact on social and economic systems. <br>In 2019, pollution killed nine million people worldwide (one in six deaths), a number unchanged since 2015<sup[2][3][4]></sup>pollution accounted for<br>m 3‚ÅÑ4 of these earlier deaths<sup>[4][5]</sup>. A 2022 literature review found that levels of anthropogenic chemical pollution have exceeded planetary <br>boundaries and now threaten entire ecosystems around the world<sup>[7][8] </sup>Pollutants frequently have outsized impacts on vulnerable populations,<br> such as children and the elderly, and marginalized communities, because polluting industries and toxic waste sites tend to be collocated with<br> populations with less economic and political power<sup>[9] </sup>This outsized impact is a core reason for the formation of the environmental justice<br> movement<sup>[10][11] </sup>and continues to be a core element of environmental conflicts, particularly in the Global South.</li>

<p><h4>One of the most significant natural sources of pollution are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcano" >volcanoes</a>, which during eruptions release large quantities of harmful gases into the <br> <br>atmosphere. Volcanic gases include carbon dioxide, which can be fatal in large concentrations and contributes to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change">Climate Change</a> , hydrogen halides <br> <br> which can cause acid rain, sulfur dioxides, which are harmful to animals and damage the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozone_layer">Ozone Layer</a> , and hydrogen sulfides, which are capable of  <br> <br>killing humans at concentrations of less than 1 part per thousand<sup>[19]</sup> Volcanic emissions also include fine and ultrafine particles which may contain  <br> <br>toxic chemicals and substances such as arsenic, lead, and mercury<sup>[20]</sup></h4></p><br><br><br><br><br>
